# Smartphone Class Implementation

This repository contains a Java implementation of the `Smartphone` class. The class represents a smartphone entity with various attributes and methods for learning purposes.

## Features:
- **Attributes**:
  - `brand` (String): The smartphone's brand.
  - `model` (String): The smartphone's model.
  - `storageCapacity` (int): The storage capacity in GB.
  - `price` (double): The price of the smartphone.
  - `isWaterResistant` (boolean): Indicates whether the smartphone is water-resistant.

- **Constructors**:
  - **Default constructor**: Initializes the attributes with default values (e.g., "Unknown Brand" and 0.0 for price).
  - **Parameterized constructor**: Allows setting the attributes when creating the object.

- **Methods**:
  - `displayInfo()`: Displays the smartphone's information in a formatted way.
  - `installApp(String appName)`: Simulates installing an app on the smartphone.

## Usage:
You can test the class by creating objects using both constructors, calling the `displayInfo()` method, and using the `installApp()` method to simulate installing an app.

## UML Diagram:
A UML class diagram is included to represent the structure of the `Smartphone` class.
